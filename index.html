        <p>These photos reflect my journey of observing the world and capturing what catches my eye. From farmers in the fields to flowers in bloom and life along the river, each image is part of my learning process — both in photography and in building this website. I’m exploring, experimenting, and improving with every shot and every line of code.</p>
